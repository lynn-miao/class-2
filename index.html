            <strong>What is congestion pricing?</strong>
            Congestion pricing refers to a fee levied on drivers that’s intended to convince enough people to avoid
            hopping in their car at rush hour. Or, as the U.S. Department of Transportation frames it, it’s “a way of
            harnessing the power of the market to reduce the waste associated with traffic congestion.”

    <strong>Why do we need congestion pricing? </strong>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Congestion is bad for businesses, residents and visitors. <br /><br />
        Ambulances stuck in traffic when every second matters. Workers late for their shifts because the bus is delayed.
        Small business owners who can't go home because they're waiting on slow deliveries. Honking horns, high
        pollution, short tempers: This congestion is bad for the economy, the environment, and the quality of life for
        people who live in the CBD, as well as for commuters, business owners, and visitors.
        <br /><br />
        Congestion makes travel slow and unreliable. Traffic increases the time it takes to get somewhere, reduces bus
        service quality, and costs businesses, since workers cannot do as much when they spend a lot of time in traffic.

        How many cars enter the Central Business District daily?
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="answer" id="answer1">Congestion has clogged Manhattan streets for decades. Over 900,000 people in
        vehicles enter the CBD daily. According to the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council, this is more than
        25% higher than the pre-pandemic levels. <a

    <div class="question-button" id="question2">
        How many people ride the MTA trains, buses, or subways every day?
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="answer" id="answer2">The MTA averages 5.5 million riders per weekday, and only 4 percent of
        outer-borough residents — around 128,000 people — drive into Manhattan to work, according to a Community Service
        Society study. Meanwhile, 57 percent use public transit. Only 2 percent of poor outer-borough residents commute
        to Manhattan by car. That’s 5,000 people in total. Meanwhile, 61 percent of poor outer-borough residents rely on
        public transit and the rest either drive elsewhere, walk, or bike to their jobs.
